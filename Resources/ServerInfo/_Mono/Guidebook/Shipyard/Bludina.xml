  "Bludina-class vessels are independently refitted support ships turned rogue mobile labs. Outfitted with chemical labs, and a compact medbay, theyâ€™re favored by outlaw groups for manufacturing and rapid treatment on the move. They come with just enough bite to discourage most would-be boarders, including an EMP turret for disabling."

  # PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST

  ## 1. Power supply

  ## 1.1. Battery units
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SMESBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SubstationBasic"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="APCBasic"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the Antimatter Engine (AME) generator is functional (View below.)
  - Check that the SMES unit is anchored to the floor.
  - Check that the substation unit is charging.
  - Check that the Engineering/Research APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.
  - Check that the APC unit's accross several rooms Breakers are toggled on.
  - Check that the Bridge APC unit's Main Breaker is toggled on.

  ## 1.2. Antimatter Engine (AME) reactor unit.
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AmeController"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AmeJar"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the AME control device is anchored to the floor and connected to a 3x3 containment shielding structure.
  - Check that the AME control device is connected to the cable terminal of your SMES via HV.
  - Check the fuel remaining of the generator unit.
  - Enable Injection.
  (Note: AMEs automatically generate power equivalent to demand.)

  ## 2. Atmospherics

  ## 2.1. Distribution Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="OxygenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="NitrogenCanister"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasMixer"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPressurePump"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the O2 canister is anchored to the BLUE connector port.
  - Check that the N2 canister is anchored to the RED connector port.
  - Check that the gas mixer is set to the correct mixing ratio (~22% Oxygen, ~78% Nitrogen).
  - Check that the gas mixer is set to 101.325kPa.
  - Enable gas mixer.

  ## 2.2. Waste Loop
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GasPassiveGate"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AirAlarm"/>
  </Box>

  - Enable waste loop pump(if applicable).

  ## 3. Other checks
  <Box>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Gyroscope"/>
  <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="GravityGeneratorMini"/>
  </Box>

  - Check that the gyroscope is anchored, powered, and enabled.
  - Check that the mini gravity generator is anchored, powered, and enabled.

## Sidenotes

  * - Bludina-class ships lack shielding. It is not made for heavy fights.

  * - EMP turret can disable enemy internals or defense systems, but must be used carefully to avoid friendly fire.

  * - Medbay includes cloner, but no advanced surgical equipment. Bring supplies accordingly.
